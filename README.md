# Carrom
Carrom using canvas.


Make a carrom board game and give a simple animation of a
striker moving in some random direction and eventually goes up in pocket(invisible).
● Carrom coins are not needed or only one may be created.
● Exact textures of the board are also not needed but at the same time it should also look
like a carrom board.
